# PolysemyInduction
Experiments on the relationship between lexical flexibility and inductive reasoning.

Experiment 1 uses a Gelman triad task, looking at property induction between (e.g.) chicken animal and chicken animal, 
compared to chicken meat and chicken animal. We vary whether the pictures are given a label ("chicken") or a demonstrative pronoun 
("this").

Experiment 2 uses the exact same task, but now varies flexible label (chicken) vs synonym (hen).
